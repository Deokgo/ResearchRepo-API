# ResearchRepo-API

## Overview

This repository contains the backend API for the ResearchRepo project. It provides data and business logic for interacting with research data and is designed to be used in conjunction with a separate frontend web application.

## Project Structure

- **API/Backend (this repository):** Handles data processing, storage, and exposes endpoints for the frontend to consume.
- **Web/Frontend:** A separate repository that provides the user interface and communicates with this API to deliver a full-stack web experience.

> **Note:** If you are looking for the frontend (web interface) repository, you can find it here:
